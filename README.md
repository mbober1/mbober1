From an early age, I am interested in widely understood electronics.
I build and design my own electronic devices. 
I am passionate about programming microcontrollers, writing drivers for peripherals, designing mobile robots. 
In my free time, I expand my smart home, automating subsequent elements in it. I am a fan of Linux systems and open source software.
