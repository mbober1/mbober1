👋 Hi there! I'm **Marcin Bober**, a passionate Embedded Systems Programmer with a strong foundation in Computer Science and Automation Engineering. 🚀

👨‍💻 As a software engineer, I specialize in crafting efficient and robust firmware for embedded systems. My journey into the world of programming began with a fascination for controlling the physical world through code, and I've been hooked ever since.

🧠 With a master's degree in Computer Science, I bring a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software design principles to my work. This knowledge helps me create elegant solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in the embedded domain.

🤖 My experience includes:
- Developing firmware for microcontrollers (mainly ESP32, STM32, RPi Pico)
- Low-level hardware interfacing and driver development
- Real-time operating systems (RTOS) for mission-critical applications
- IoT device development and connectivity protocols
- Collaborating with hardware engineers to create seamless hardware-software integration
- many more! ([check out my CV](https://marcinbober.pl/download/CV.pdf))

🌟 I thrive on challenges and am constantly seeking innovative ways to optimize code and enhance system performance. My commitment to quality and attention to detail ensure that the software I deliver is reliable and robust.

🚀 Outside of work, you'll find me tinkering with electronics, creating IoT devices, developing my smart-home.
